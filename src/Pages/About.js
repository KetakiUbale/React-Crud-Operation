                  Admin Dashboard : 

Build an admin dashboard that can show stats, reports, charts and graphs. This project is mainly to show that you can build a frontend interface so it can use dummy information. You don’t have to create the charts and graphs from scratch, using a plugin is fine. If you are like me and aren’t good at design, you can take a look at Theme Forest (not sponsored), for some ideas on how the dashboard could look. If you really want to, you can copy a design exactly, just don’t copy the code, treat it like it’s a photoshop file and you need to make it come to life.

Restaurant Menu Manager  :  

This will help show off both your frontend and backend skills. You’ll need to create an admin area where a user can create menu items and categories to display on a restaurant’s menu. Then you’ll also need a customer facing page that displays the menu nicely. Again, if you’re not good at design, Theme Forest also has templates you can get ideas from if you need.
